## Business Problem

The business problem to be solved using this data set is as follows:

A demand forecasting model is required for 10 different stores and 50 different products to predict sales for the next 3 months. The demand prediction model will be used to forecast future sales for a specific store and product combination. This model can support decisions related to inventory management, demand planning, and inventory optimization.

Additionally, the data set will be aggregated to a weekly level, and a demand forecasting model will be developed for the year 2017. Weekly demand forecasts will be used to anticipate changes in sales for specific store and product combinations throughout the year 2017.

Data mining, machine learning, and time series analysis techniques can be employed when working with this data set and addressing the business problem.
